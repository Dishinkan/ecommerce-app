Create a multi-role e-commerce application with the following features:

Platform Roles Order Manager:
Can view the product catalog (storefront) assigned to their restaurant.

Can enter quantities for the products they want to order.

Orders are not sent immediately but saved in a temporary cart.

At 4:00 PM, the system automatically finalizes the order, checks for abnormal quantities, notifies the user, and sends them a full order confirmation email.

Window Dresser:

Manages the storefront (products with name, description, supplier, images, price, notes).

Decides, via flags, which products are visible to which restaurants/users.

Cannot view or access the global order history.

Admin (Restaurant Owner):

Can view the order history only for their own restaurant.

Database view with filtering and sorting options (by date, product, supplier, quantity, etc.).

Order database fields: Restaurant name, User name, Product name, Quantity, Unit price, Total price, Supplier, Order date, Notes.

Cannot access other restaurants’ data.

Architect (Me, platform creator):

A secret role that must remain completely hidden from all other roles.

Has full visibility: total users, total restaurants, order history across all restaurants, subscription status.

Can calculate expected revenue based on active restaurant subscriptions (each restaurant = one subscription, even if multiple users belong to it).

Can suspend or block access to restaurants and their users if payments are missing or if discrepancies are detected.

This role must never be visible or disclosed to clients (Order Managers, Admins, or Window Dressers).

Order Management At 4:00 PM daily:
Validate the order quantities.

Send confirmation email to the user.

Split orders by supplier and send one email per supplier, including the restaurant name and the full list of items/quantities ordered.

Central Database Each order must be saved with:
Restaurant name

User name

Product name

Quantity

Unit price

Total price

Supplier

Order date

Notes

Business Model Revenue model = subscription per restaurant (not per user).
The Architect role must be able to monitor the ratio of users to restaurants in order to calculate revenue and detect fraud or underreporting.

If a restaurant does not pay, the Architect can block all associated users and lock the restaurant’s access.

Mobile Accessibility The app must be fully usable on mobile devices with a responsive and optimized interface.
